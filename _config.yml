Hello, I'm an engineer with a passion for data and coding. 
As a dedicated data scientist, I thrive on exploring innovative approaches and continuous learning, 
particularly within Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects. My expertise lies in leveraging data to uncover insights and develop solutions, driving impactful outcomes.


Beyond the realm of data science, I am captivated by mathematics and deeply rooted in Paraguayan culture. I find solace in artistic expressions through drawing and crafting, 
nurturing a diverse range of personal interests and creative pursuits.
